Please read the following steps making the app running




## How to make it running

In the project directory, you can edit the .env file:

SET : `REACT_APP_WS_ADRESS` to `react.realmit.io`

SET : `REACT_APP_WS_PORT=` to `443`

SET : `REACT_APP_WS_PROTOCOL` to `wss`

## Render

With codesandbox, design is destroyed. Be sure this isn't my fault 
and I did my best to make it beautiful as I can

## It looks like Discord isn't it ?

Good job Captain obvious 

## Running on Linux

Thanks not to ask how running it on Windows, I will not answer :D

#### Step 1 :

Enter the project folder and run :

##### `npm install`

#### Step 2 :

Run :

##### `npm start`

A new browser window is going to open. In case it won't you can go to :

`http://loaclhost:8080`

## Running your own server

If you want to run your own server, please check my repo' :
https://github.com/Lorddistrict/coursReactServer

Follow the same steps than running on Linux and edit :

SET : `REACT_APP_WS_ADRESS` to `localhost`

SET : `REACT_APP_WS_PORT=` to `8080`

SET : `REACT_APP_WS_PROTOCOL` to `ws`
